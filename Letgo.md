**DEVICE FORENSIC ARTIFACTS**  

ANDROID  

The Letgo application version 2.3.7 was installed on a HTC One operating Android 6 Marshmello.  The device WAS NOT jailbroke.  The application requests the following permissions: Camera, Contacts, Locations, Phone, and Storage.  

The app was used to post an item for sale to the classified ad sales space.  This ad included text and images.  Several direct messages were exchanged with other Letgo users.  None of this data was deleted prior to the device examination.  

A logical exam of the device was conducted using the mobile device forensic tools Cellebrite UFED, Secure View, and Lantern.  All of the tools identified the application was installed on the machine and the email account used for log-in.  None of the images, chat messages, or databases were recovered.  

APPLE IOS  

The Letgo application was installed on an Apple Ipad operating IOS 11.2.1.  As with the Android device the app was used to post a sale ad and exchange chat messages with other users.  

The device was examined using the mobile device forensic tool Lantern.  The results were similar to those found during the exmaination of the Android device.  None of the images, chat messages, or databases were recovered.
