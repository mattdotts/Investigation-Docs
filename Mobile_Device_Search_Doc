Mobile Device Search Warrant (Pennsylvania) – to search a physical device (not for cellular company Call Detail Records).

### Specific Description of Premises and and/or Person to be Search:

Describe the device in absolute values.

Example:  The device is an Apple iPhone 8 Plus assigned serial number XXXXXXXXXX and IMEI number XXXXXXXXXXXX.  The device has a glass front and gray painted aluminum back.

### Identify Items to be Searched For and Seized:

Short Version:

Electronically stored digital data saved to the internal storage or any removable media of [DEVICE].  This digital content includes, but is not limited to, device identification numbers, contact logs, call logs, text logs, text message content, email content, images, videos, calendars, notes, internet browsing traffic logs and history, location and GPS data logs, and any other application SQL database.

Long Version:

Data logs that may contain contact names, phone numbers and addresses.  Call logs which detail incoming and outgoing phone calls. SMS and MMS messages and logs that my contain correspondence date and times along with message content. Email messages and attachments. Data files consisting of digital pictures, videos, and documents and access to corresponding data to show creation, modification, access, and deleted dates and times .  Internet browsing records which may contain browsing history, cache, stored cookies, stored websites, stored images, form history, and saved passwords.  Global positioning system (GPS) data which may contain location coordinates, waypoints, tracks, and history. Device specific files and content consisting of application data and stored SQL databases. Stored Data, including username and password, linking said phone to another computer, cloud account, or back-up service.

*You must justify the need to collect these items in your affidavit – See notes on particularity*

### Name of Owner:

List the actual owner and custodian.  (Dad may own the device and have the cellular service account but son uses the device.)

### Violation of:

List the crime for which you believe the device contains evidence to support. This may not be the most serious crime that the person is suspected of or has been charged with.

### Affidavit:

Paragraph 1:  Officer biography – Introduce yourself and your authority to search for and seize evidence during criminal investigations.  Provide a synopsis of education and training – related to the crime your are investigating.  If you are seeking to search a phone for a drug crime there is no need to detail your experience investigating motor vehicle crashes.

Paragraph 2: Provide facts to support probable cause to search the device.  Who, What, Where, When and How!

Paragraph 3: Particularity – link the device to the crime.  Why do you believe there is evidence of the crime contained within the contents of the device. Explain what you are searching for on the device and how it is connected to the criminal act or furthers the investigation.

Paragraph 4:  Provide justification for enhanced manipulation and forensic procedures to access data stored on the device.

Example:

Based on my knowledge and training and through speaking with other law enforcement officers who have conducted such investigations, I know that mobile digital devices can hold volatile data which requires specialized tools, software, and training to access.  Analyzing such devices for criminal evidence is a highly technical process requiring expert skill and a properly controlled environment.  There is a variety of hardware and software available to process such devices.  It is difficult to know prior to the search which expert possesses the skill needed to best examine the device.  Likewise, it is difficult to know which hardware and software will be needed to best examine the device.  It is sometimes necessary to take a device to a secondary laboratory or examiner to access data on the device. Additionally, it may take days or months to complete the examination due to the amount of data that may be on the device or due to data hiding and obfuscation techniques used by the suspect.

Cellular telephones utilizing a computer style file system to store, organize, retrieve, and display digital data in a human readable form and generally can store the equivalent of thousands of pages of information. This may require searching authorities to examine all the stored data to determine which files are evidence or instrumentalities of crimes.  This sorting process can take an extended amount of time, depending on the volume of data stored, and it would be impractical to attempt this kind of data search on site

Searching for the evidence described above may require a range of data analysis techniques.  In some cases, it is possible for investigators to conduct carefully targeted searches that can locate evidence without requiring a time-consuming manual search through unrelated materials that may be commingled with criminal evidence.  For example, investigators may be able to execute a "keyword" search that searches through the files stored in a computer for special words that are likely to appear only in the materials covered by a warrant.  Similarly, investigators may be able to locate the materials covered in the warrant by looking for particular directory or file names.  In other cases, however, such techniques may not yield the evidence described in the warrant.  Criminals can mislabel or hide files and directories; encode communications to avoid using key words; attempt to delete files to evade detection; or take other steps designed to frustrate law enforcement searches for information.   These steps may require investigators to conduct more extensive searches, such as scanning areas of the device’s memory not allocated to listed files or opening every file and scanning its contents briefly to determine whether it falls within the scope of the warrant.  Considering these difficulties, your affiant requests permission to use whatever data analysis techniques appear necessary to locate and retrieve the evidence described above.

The device may be protected by some form of security technique or encryption scheme that will require a passcode, PIN code, or password.  Enhanced scientific and forensic techniques may be needed to defeat these security controls.  There is no way to determine the time that will be needed to crack these codes and access the data stored on the device.

Authorization is also requested to execute this warrant and to conduct a forensic examination performed by a qualified forensic analyst on the aforementioned item until such examination is complete.

Authorization is also requested to utilize enhanced forensic techniques to access files that have been hidden, erased, compressed, password protected, coded or encrypted.

Paragraph 5:  OPTIONAL.  Justify access to cloud accounts.  Explain that these devices access external storage through the Internet.  You must provide details on what cloud accounts you want to access and why you believe there is evidence of the crime store within this cloud drive.

You cannot just say – “any and all cloud storage accounts”. That could be dozens of accounts that have absolutely no connection to the crime.  For example, if you are investigating the sales of illegal drugs, it would be completely justified for you to request access to the users Google maps data to see where he is traveling to conduct sales.  There would be no justification for you to access his health records through the Penn State Health application his device is still logged into.

Paragraph 6: Summarize and specifically request that the search warrant be authorized - just some simple closing to finalize the affidavit.

Example:

As set forth by the facts presented in this affidavit, your affiant believes that John Does is responsible for the burglary of 123 Main Street and the associated theft of a Glock 27 handgun.  Your affiant also believes the Apple iPhone 8 seized from him on April 1, 2020, contains evidence of these crimes.  Your affiant respectfully requests that this search warrant be authorized so the device can be search for such evidence.

### Notes:

There is no “Good Faith Exception” in Pennsylvania and the validity of the warrant is based on the content within the “four-corners” of the affidavit page. Rule 203 of the Pennsylvania Rules of Criminal Procedure specifies, “The issuing authority, in determining whether probable cause has been established, may not consider any evidence outside the affidavits.”  You must meet the requirements of probable cause and particularity within the submitted affidavit. See Commonwealth V. Edmunds 526 Pa. 374 (1991).

Particularity: The warrant cannot seek “any and all data” or some other catch all language. (see Commonwealth v. Orie, 88 A.3d 983(Pa. Super. 2014)).  The warrant must particularly describe what data is being sought from the device and the affidavit of probable cause must explain why you are seeking it.  Bonus points it you can narrow down a specific time frame.

The following is excerpt from United States V. Winn 79 F. Supp. 3d 904 (S.D. Ill. 2015) regarding particularity and the use of templates:

The major, overriding problem with the description of the object of the search—“any or all files”—is that the police did not have probable cause to believe that everything on the phone was evidence of the crime of public indecency. The description was a template used by the St. Clair County State's Attorney's Office for all cell phone searches. Templates are, of course, fine to use as a starting point. But they must be tailored to the facts of each case. This particular template authorized the seizure of virtually every piece of data that could conceivably be found on the phone. The Supreme Court put the scope of such a wholesale seizure in perspective by explaining that it “would typically expose the government to far more than the most exhaustive search of a house.” Riley v. California, ––– U.S. ––––, 134 S.Ct. 2473, 2491, 189 L.Ed.2d 430 (2014) (emphasis in original). Obviously, the police will not have probable cause to search through and seize such an expansive array of data every time they search a cell phone. And, in the case of a misdemeanor crime, it is difficult to fathom why the police would ever need, or have probable cause, to do so. That certainly holds true in the instant case.
