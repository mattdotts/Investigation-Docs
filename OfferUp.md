###### Release 1.2 \(01/29/20\)
___
**INTRODUCTION**    

OfferUp is a mobile application classified advertisement service founded in 2011 and headquartered in the suburbs of Seattle, Washington.  The service promotes itself as, "the largest mobile marketplace in the United States", having facilitated the exchange of over 20 billion dollars of goods in 2017.  It is estimated to have 7.3 million monthly users and routinely ranks in the top ten downloads for both the Apple IOS and Android applications.  

The application allows users to earn verification badges and positive review attributes to build trust between buyers and sellers.  Users can also link profiles from other social media accounts such as Facebook.  The application includes a chat function that allows buyers and sellers to instantly connect and communicate within the app.  This eliminates the need for external communication sources such as email and telephone.  

The business is privately owned by co-founders Nick Huzvar and Arean Van Velelan.
