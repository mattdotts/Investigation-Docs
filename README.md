# Investigative Documents       

Welcome to my collection of Investigative Documents.  These are designed to assist law enforcement investigators during Internet and Technology investigations.

The documents are written in markdown format and can be read by any modern web browser or text editor.  Each document is titled as the subject matter with a .md extention.  For instance, the white paper for the classified ad application "Letgo" is titled Letgo.md.  Simply click on the Letgo.md file link in the above repository menu and the document will open in your browser.  You can copy text directly from the document if you need it for a search warrant application or some other documentation.  You can also take a complete copy of the document through the clone function.
