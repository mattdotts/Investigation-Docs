Professor Eugene Volokh of the UCLA School of Law published an insightful and timely review of the laws applicable to offenses committed within cyber-spaces.  Just because someone acted stupidly within a Zoom meeting DOES NOT mean they committed a crime.

*_Who has jurisdiction to investigate an offense?_*  The commonsense answer is the law enforcement agency that has jurisdiction over where the HOST was seated (home or work).  Another opinion is that anyone who was in the meeting and was exposed to the egregious communication could claim victimhood.   Consult with your District Attorney for an opinion.
